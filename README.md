# 📈 Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

This project dives into customer data from a Portuguese bank’s marketing campaign, using machine learning and analytics to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. Built with Python and real-world campaign data, this notebook shows how data-driven marketing can save time, money, and effort.

## 📂 Project Overview

| 📊 Project | 🔍 Description |
|------------|----------------|
| **Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis** | A machine learning-based analysis of a Portuguese bank's telemarketing data to predict term deposit subscriptions. Built using Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. |

## 🚀 Project Goals
- Understand client behavior through data exploration.
- Build predictive models to identify potential subscribers.
- Provide actionable insights to improve future marketing campaigns.

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
- SMOTE (for imbalanced data)
- Data preprocessing, visualization, and classification modeling

## 🧠 Core ML Models

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 🔹 Logistic Regression | Simple baseline model to evaluate feature impact |
| 🔹 Random Forest | High-performing model with feature importance insights |
| 🔹 XGBoost | Tuned model with great accuracy on imbalanced data |

## 📊 Key Insights
- Age, contact method, and previous campaign outcomes significantly influence subscription rates.
- Clients contacted via cell phones had a higher conversion rate.
- Imbalanced data handling improved model performance and stability.
